## Analysis and Investigation Results

### Jersey City Comparison of Year 2019 and 2020 Dashboard

This dashboard investigates the Jersey City CitiBike data from the years 2019 and 2020. This dataset was used, rather than the full New York City dataset, as the files were smaller, allowing many files to be examined at once within Tableau. After some comparisons to small sections of the New York CitiBike data, the Jersey City data appeared to behave very similarly, and therefore can be used as a preliminary model of the New York data.

Multiple trends were examined on this dashboard. The average trip duration was compared through the months of 2019 and 2020, and it can be seen that the trip duration increased significantly in the year 2020. This trend started in March of 2020 and continued throughout the months examined. However, interestingly enough, the number of rides for the year 2020 decreased from the year 2019, meaning less rides were taken, but lasted much longer. The age group that seemed to take the most rides in both years appeared to be 51 years old. This age's number of rides doubled in 2020, while most other age groups decreased from 2019. Finally, the usertype trends between 2019 and 2020 appeared to remain constant. Male subscribers were by far the largest group, but the number of male subscribers dropped dramatically in 2020, from approximately 177,000 to 108,000. The second largest group (female subscribers) also dropped, from approximately 52,000 to 39,000. This follows the point that there were less overall rides in 2020. 

The reason for these trends can most readily be explained by the emergence of COVID-19. The duration of rides seemed to start increasing in March, right around the time when people were beginning to quarantine due to the virus, and likely wanted to get some time outside. The number of rides decreased overall, which can be explained by many people deciding to stay home and reduce chances of catching the virus. Once restrictions are lifted and COVID risks are lessened, it is possible that the number of rides will again increase.

### Breakdown of Yearly Trends Dashboard

Membership data, miles traveled, and number of passes sold were investigated in this dashboard over the last 3 years. 2019 data was only available until the beginning of June (and no 2020 data was available). However, useful information can still be gained from looking at the last several years' trends. The trends were analyzed starting in 2016, since 2015 Q3 data was missing, and the aim was to show complete year trends, where possible.

First, passes sold by month was investigated. Keep in mind that the 24-hour pass data is shown on the left axis and the 3-day pass data is shown on the right axis. It can be seen that many more 24-hour passes are sold than 3-day passes. However, it can be seen that both types of passes peak between the May and October timeframes. Knowing this, it might be worth exploring price changes during these periods to boost sales. Do keep in mind that 2019 data through Q2 was not complete, so the drop that can be seen in June is likely due to this.

Looking at the sum of passes sold each year, it is even more evident how many more 24-hour passes are sold than 3-day passes. The number of 24-hour passes is steadily growing each year, while the number of 3-day passes does not seem to vary very much. All the while, it can be seen that the number of members continues to grow by approximately 50,000 each year.

Next a comparison of the number of daily trips and the number of passes purchased can be seen. There are relatively very few passes sold versus trips taken, indicating that many trips are taken by non-members. Perhaps this is an opportunity to offer some benefits if customers become members.

Finally, the number of miles traveled each day peaks in the summer months as expected (Q2-Q3), and the number of daily trips follows this trend as well.

Considering that 3-day passes do not seem to be in high favor, it might be worth exploring 2-day passes, to bring the gap between the highly profitable 24-hour passes and the considerably less profitable 3-day passes.

### Map Analysis

Comparing start and end points for trips, we will look at August 2020 (the most up to date data we have access to). It can be seen that all start locations (blue shades) occur within New York, but some end locations (red shades) appear in Jersey City. It can also be seen that the stations that are most heavily utilized are on the island of Manhattan, with lesser activity in the surrounding boroughs. 

The maps were overlaid with a layer showing male:female ratio information for 2018 (slightly outdated information but a good indicator for the breakdown of males and females in New York City). Interestingly, much of Manhattan shows a high female to male ratio. However, from the Jersey City dashboard, it was seen that males typically make up a majority of the riders in the program. This area would be the best area to target marketing campaigns toward females.
